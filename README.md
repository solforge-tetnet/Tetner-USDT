# Tetner Ecosystem

🌐 https://solforge-tetnet.github.io/Tetner-USDT/

Welcome to **Tetner**, a Web3 ecosystem powered by the USDT token on the Tron blockchain. Tetner unites Telegram bots, mobile games, NFTs, and decentralized governance — all under one token economy.

---

## 📌 Introduction

**Tetner Ecosystem** is a decentralized playground where the USDT token (TRC-20) powers all interactions. From gaming rewards to governance voting, our mission is to empower users with true ownership and participation across platforms.

---

## ⚠️ The Problem

Modern Web2 apps and games suffer from:

- ❌ Centralized control over in-game currencies  
- ❌ Opaque economic systems  
- ❌ No player influence on project development  

---

## ✅ Our Solution

Tetner’s USDT token solves this by offering:

- 🛍 In-game purchases and NFT ownership  
- 🎮 Telegram-based tournaments and lotteries  
- 🗳 DAO-based voting and decision-making  
- 🎁 Rewards for active community members
